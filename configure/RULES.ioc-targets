# Notes re IOCS_APPL_TOP vs IOC_APPL_TOP
# IOCS_APPL_TOP is the traditional macro for EPICS that
# is set to the absolute pathname of INSTALL_LOCATION.
# The ioc can use this to locate it's executables, db files, etc
#
# IOC_APPL_TOP was introduced by SLAC for templated ioc's
# IOC_APPL_TOP gets set in the build files for templated
# ioc's to the TOP for it's parent IOC build.
# The build system and the ioc application use this to locate
# the executables, db files, etc
#
# While nearly the same, convertRelease needs to use the
# -t option for IOCS_APPL_TOP and the
# -T option for IOC_APPL_TOP
# to find the RELEASE* files
