# P and M combine to make the instance's name.
# P EPICS PV Prefix
# M Motor number (please use leading 0, i.e. 01, 02, ...)
# DTYP is the motor driver name for our motors.
# C is controller; this links to the ASYN port
#   ASYN gives digi port a name
#   MDrivePlusConfig maps digi name to controller #.
# ACCL is the time to accelerate from the base speed to full speed.
# DIR is the direction of rotation, "Pos" or "Neg"

# SREV (not shown) is the number of steps per revolution is 200 by default
#
# There are three pivot points to which the six motors are attached.
#   Three provide vertical motion: M0Y, M1Y, and M2Y.
#   M2Z provides horizontal motion in the Z direction (along beamline)
#   M0X and M2X provide horiz motion in the X direction (perpendicular to beamline):
#

# 
# For SREV:
#    2048 = internal encoder (EQ)
#     250 = external encoder, NUMERIK-JENA
#     200 = external encoder, Renishaw
#   51200 = no encoder

# NOTE: Soft limits (DHLM & DLLM) may be better off using HLM & LLM and
# relying on autosave to keep those than loading them into the database everytime.
# If the motor is reversed in DIR, then the DHLM and HLM are reveresed
# which makes it difficult to accurately set the soft limits.
# (Dial) DHLM 140, DLLM 2 is equivalent to (User) HLM -2, LLM -140
